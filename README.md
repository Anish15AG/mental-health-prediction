# Mental Health Prediction App

## Overview
The Mental Health Prediction App is a self-analysis tool designed to predict possible mental health conditions based on user-provided symptoms and details. The project combines robust machine learning techniques with a natural language explanation component. Two models—Random Forest and XGBoost—are developed for multi-class classification, while a pre-trained LLM (DistilGPT-2) generates detailed explanations and suggestions regarding the predictions.

This application is built for easy integration into chatbots or web-based interfaces, offering both command-line and interactive UI (Streamlit) options.
